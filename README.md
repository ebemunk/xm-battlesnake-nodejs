# battlesnake-nodejs

A simple [BattleSnake AI](http://battlesnake.io) written for NodeJS.

To get started you'll need a working NodeJS development environment, and at least read the Heroku docs on [deploying a NodeJS app](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs). This client uses [Express4](http://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html) for easy route management, read up on the docs to learn more about reading incoming JSON params, writing responses, etc.


## Prerequisite Software
You'll need the follwing software on your computer before you can get started:
- [GitHub CLI 2.x](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Heroku CLI 5.x](https://cli.heroku.com/).

You'll need the following software on your computer if you want to compile and run the application locally. This is completely optional but probably desired since troubleshooting coding errors and testing behaviour will be much easier. 
- [NodeJs 6.x or 7.x](https://nodejs.org/)
- [NPM 3.x](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) - This is installed with NodeJS

If you haven't setup a NodeJS development environment before, read [how to get started with NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/documentation/tutorials/). You'll also need [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) for easy JS dependency management.

If you have the software installed already, confirm by running the respective commands on the command prompt and check the versions:
- ```npm -v```
- ```node -v```
- ```git --version```
- ```heroku --version```

## Preparing your project
You'll also need the (free) accounts from the following services:
- Create a free account on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)
- Create a free [GitHub account](https://github.com)
- Sign in to GitHub and Fork this [project](https://github.com/xmatters-tko/xm-battlesnake-nodejs/fork)

## Test Your Environment Setup
At this point, make sure that all of you software is installed, and you've forked this project correctly. Run the following commands:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/<your account>/xm-battlesnake-nodejs.git
$ cd xm-battlesnake-nodejs
$ heroku local
```

Your app should now be running on [localhost:5000/health](http://localhost:5000/health).

### Testing your local app
You can use curl commands to easily test if you snake is working and responding to end points.

Run it locally using heroku command:
```
$ heroku local
```

#### /start Endpoint
```
$ curl localhost:5000/start -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"width":20,"height":20,"game_id":"example-game-id"}'
```

#### /move Endpoint
```
$ curl localhost:5000/move -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{ "you": "2c4d4d70-8cca-48e0-ac9d-03ecafca0c98","width": 2,"turn": 0,"snakes": [{ "taunt": "git gud","name": "my-snake","id": "2c4d4d70-8cca-48e0-ac9d-03ecafca0c98","health_points": 93,"coords": [[0,0],[0,0],[0,0]] },{ "taunt": "gotta go fast","name": "other-snake","id": "c35dcf26-7f48-492c-b7b5-94ae78fbc713","health_points": 50,"coords": [[1,0],[1,0],[1,0]] }],"height": 2,"game_id": "a2facef2-b031-44ba-a36c-0859c389ef96","food": [[1,1]],"dead_snakes": [{ "taunt": "gotta go fast","name": "other-snake","id": "83fdf2b9-c8d0-44f4-acb2-0c506139079e","health_points": 50,"coords": [[5,0],[5,0],[5,0]] }] }'
```

## Deploying to Heroku

### Create an App
Next, create an application on Heroku and give it a name that represents your project. This will create a remote git repo for Heroku to use to deploy and run your project.
```sh
$ heroku create [APP NAME]
$ git push heroku master
```
The output should end with the URL endpoint of your snake. Use this URL to add your snake to a game on the server.
```
remote: -----> Launching...
remote:        Released v3
remote:        https://my-snake.herokuapp.com/ deployed to Heroku
remote:
remote: Verifying deploy... done.
```

### Pushing Updates to Heroku
You have to commit your changes to your git project as part of pushing them to the remote heroku git.
```sh
$ git add --all; git commit -m "Updated"; git push
$ git push heroku master
```

### Debugging Logs on Heroku
Once your snake is running, you can tail the logs any time in the console using the command:
```sh
$ heroku logs --tail
```
